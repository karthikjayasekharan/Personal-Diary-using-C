# Personal-Diary-using-C
Personal Diary Management system using C programming

# Introduction

In this project, user can keep their personal record like they do in a diary. You can keep records of the important things you do in your daily life, like meetings and various other tasks. This mini project on Personal Diary Management is compiled in C. Each Section contain high security so there is no chance of data loss. There’s maximum privacy to the recorded files. This System makes easy to store daily records.

# Abstract

o This is used to keep private information about your life and record various events like meetings and various other tasks.

o It can be used in applications where you enter notes and daily tasks

o This application is can be used by people who tend to forget daily events
  And since it is password protected , only the user will be able to view it.
  In this you need to enter a password to view, edit or delete record.
  Password is not required to view the main menu or to add record.
  You can edit the password within the application i.e., after executing or
  upon running the project.


# Project

In this project you could add name, date, event so what it needed was a password protection which could protect it from others viewing or accessing it, other than the user.
I have added this feature referring to similar projects and using the code for it
As it had more than 1000 lines of code I had use external help to compile the code in the correct format.
The code took a while to compile as there were too many lines for it
The screenshots are given below
The basic user-defined functions used in this project are listed below:

· int password() – contains/manages/handles password protection

· void addrecord() – to add new diary record

· void viewrecord() – to view added record in list

· void editrecord() – to modify and update an added record

· void editpassword() – to modify/change a password

· void deleterecord() – to delete or remove a record permanently from system file

The password system didn’t work as planned so there will be errors when you want to change password and or try to enter a new one.
Overall the diary entry is working fine with not much issues other than time for compiling it.
This can be issued with a proper deployment of the code. Although right now I am familiar with executing huge codes properly.

# Summary

In this project, user can keep their personal record like they do in a diary. You can keep records of the important things you do in your daily life, like meetings and various other tasks. This mini project on Personal Diary Management is compiled in C. There’s maximum privacy to the recorded files. This System makes easy to store daily records. So you can view edit your information and protect it with a password from others accessing it.

Since there is a problem with a password protection system although with necessary codes I can correct it.

# Conclusions

This project has given me a greater insight into C programming by learning new code operations and I can definitely improve my ability after doing this code although I had help from external sources and I would definitely would need a deeper knowledge to do much better code implementations and work on better projects.

I would like thank Dr.Rajesh Kannan sir for giving us an opportunity to do this project which made us understand more about the codes and C Programming languages
